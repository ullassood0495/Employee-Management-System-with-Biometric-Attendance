# Employee-Management-System-with-Biometric-Attendance

An Employee Management System consists of crucial work-related and important personal information about an employee. It is like an online inventory of all employees of an organization. Employees are the strength of any organization, and it is more so in case of a growing business. It is crucial to handle this aspect of your business well. A good employee management system can actually make a world of difference to an organization, especially true in case of start-ups and small businesses, where the focus should be on growing the business more than anything else.

This feature-rich, fully customizable and scalable application makes it easier and more efficient to monitor and manage employees. This application enables the business organization to make more efficient use of their resources while saving time and money both. 

## Biometric Details
As the system has Biometric support, it uses a simple microcontroller enables finger print module for attendance marking. The microcontroller used is an Arduino uno r3 connected with a r305 finger print module. The Arduino communicates with the application using serial connection between the system and Arduino. The module is only activated when it is needed. The following diagram shows the interfacing of Arduino with r305 module.

Description 
- The red wire is the power supply to the r305 module of 5V.
- The black wire is the ground wire.
- The Blue wire represents RX pin of the module and receives data from Arduino via it.
- The yellow wire represents the TX pin of the module and sends data to the Arduino via it.
